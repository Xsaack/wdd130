        <p>Hello! My name is Isaac Gaxiola Franco and I am from Sinaloa, Mexico. I really enjoy sunsets and good food, the things I make are often not amazing, but I make up for that with a lot of effort. I don't like to disappoint people, although that can be a bad habit, I have focused on it to always give my best. I work in hospitality, but I want to change my profession to software developer, it's something I've always dreamed of. Nice to meet you!!</p>
